Changes v0.54.0:

Calculating PID number works in two ways:
a) when file is empty (new file) then PID number of new added critter is calculated depend on last PID number 
readed from FODLG.MSG file. The critters name will be "new critter",
b) when file is not empty (contains proto critters) then PID number is calculated depend on last PID number 
readed from last position in ListView of loaded proto critters.

Newly created entry of critter has default name: "new critter". But when there is any name entry in FODLG.MSG 
file with PID number equal to PID number of new added critter, then the name is taken from FODLG.MSG. This is 
a signal about two facts:
a) there is existed a proto with that PID number in other *.fopro file, check manually other files for 
this PID number or load them to editor to see. Don't use this PID and name for avoid to overwrite existed in 
other *.fopro files,
b) there is not such proto in any *.fopro file, but only entries existed in FODLG.MSG. In this situation you 
can safe use it.

When press upper SAVE button for saving List to file, the entries with name: "new critter" will be not saved 
to FODLG.MSG and entries will be deleted from a List.
This is for better organise and prevent to make empty entries in FODLG.MSG. 
Remember, if you want to save your new critter first change default name ("new critter") to any other before 
press upper Save button.

DESCRIPTION:
This program is for easy edit and create proto critter in TLA Fonline. 

It uses files from SDK:
*.fopro
CritterTypes.cfg
FODLG.MSG  (any language, but engl is default)

There is a file "critter_editor.dat". This is a pack of critters *.frm pictures converted to *.png.



ATTENTION! 
It works with any language "fodlg.msg" file. Default is English (engl). The tool supports Russian language too (russ).

Setup third language:
To add third language, run first time the tool. It create an *.ini file. There are three vars named lang%.
First two are default: engl, russ. Third is empty. Use 4-letter name of the new Directory of *.msg files in your language.


Make BACKUP	of files:
*.fopro
fodlg.msg

You can do it manually or use button [Backup] in program. 
It creates a zip archive of *.fopro and fodlg.msg (for each language).




The tool is not perfect and it is possible to lost your changes. So always remember about the button "SAVE" in right lower corner.
It saves all changes made in current edited/viewed critter, but not save's to file. If you are going to select (or add, delete) 
another critter to view/edit from critters list, press SAVE for saving your changes (if you did any) in current critter. 

##########################################################################
In other words: before you select next critter from left list, press SAVE.
##########################################################################


To save to file all your changes made in any critter press button "Save". It calls automatically on exit from program too.

Requirements to build documentation:

- Doxygen
  
  Doxygen doesn't directly support AngelScript. Although AngelScript syntax is pretty similar
  to C++ syntax doxygen parser ignores handles (@ and @+) and messes array type identifiers ([])
  in the type declarations.
  
  Therefore some slight adjustments have been introduced to the doxygen parser. You can
  find windows binary based on modified version of doxygen 1.5.9 in tools\doxygen\bin\win32.
  Also you can try to build doxygen from the sources using patch file which can be found in the
  tools\doxygen\src directory.

Requirements to generate wiki documentation:

  doxygen2wiki is a simple tool heavily based on the doxygen2gwiki (http://code.google.com/p/doxygen2gwiki/)
  written on Python with a usage of the Cheetah template engine. Therefore you need:
  - Python (http://python.org/)
  - Cheetah (http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/)

Optional tools:

- Code::Blocks IDE (www.codeblocks.org/)

  You can find Code::Blocks project file in the root directory. With a conjuction to makefile it's
  a very handy documentation development engine: it supports doxygen comment highlighting, outlines
  AngelScript code and can filter out error and warning messages from doxygen.
